enhancing human-computer interaction through effective emotion recognition.
Introduction
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an evolving field that focuses on identifying human emotions
through voice analysis. This project aims to enhance the accuracy of emotion detection using
advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks, we seek to capture the nuanced features and temporal dynamics of speech signals.
Our methodology involves several key steps: preprocessing audio data, extracting relevant features,
and training our models. The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure quality and
consistency. Feature extraction techniques are employed to distill essential characteristics from the
raw audio signals. We then apply K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation and
mitigate overfitting, providing a reliable estimate of model performance.
The CNN model is adept at capturing spatial features from the spectrogram representations of audio
signals, while the RNN and LSTM models excel in handling sequential data, effectively capturing
temporal dependencies. The performance of each model is assessed using accuracy metrics and
confusion matrices, which offer detailed insights into the classification capabilities and areas for
improvement.
Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in SER, with each model contributing
uniquely to the task. This project underscores the significance of integrating multiple deep learning
architectures to achieve superior emotion recognition performance, paving the way for more
intuitive and responsive human-computer interaction systems.
